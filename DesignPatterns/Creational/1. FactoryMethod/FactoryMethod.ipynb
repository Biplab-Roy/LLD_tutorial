    "- We have a factory, which creates and return different type of objects of a class based on some condition.\n",
    "- One of the important feature of Factory Method is for the client what matters is the type not the implementations. In this example factory returns the Shape object, not any particular shape.\n",
    "- In the following Example1, we have **ShapeFactory.cpp**, which produce objects of different shapes.\n",
    "\n",

    "#### Implementation\n",
    "- **Factories as singletons**. An application typically needs only one instance of a ConcreteFactory per product family. So it’s usually best implemented as a Singleton.\n",
    "- **Creating the products**. AbstractFactory only declares an interface for creating products. It’s up to ConcreteProduct subclasses to actually create them. The most common way to do this is to define a factory method (see Factory Method (107)) for each product. A concrete factory will specify its products by overriding the factory method for each."
